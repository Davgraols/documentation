Using the ownCloud Web Interface
================================

You can access your files with the ownCloud Web interface, as well as: *create*, *preview*, *edit*, *delete*, *share*, and *re-share* files. 

.. IMPORTANT::
   Your ownCloud administrator has the option to disable these features. If any
   of them are missing on your system ask your server administrator.
