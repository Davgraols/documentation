SAML 2.0 Based SSO with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and mod_shibboleth
======================================================================================

Preparation
===========

Before you can setup SAML 2.0 based SSO with `Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb897402.aspx>`_ and mod_shibboleth, ask your ADFS admin for the relevant server URLs.
These are:

- The SAML 2.0 single sign-on service URL, e.g., ``https://sts.hostname.tld/adfs/ls``
- The IdP metadata URL, e.g., ``https://sts.hostname.tld/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml``

Then, make sure that the web server is accessible with a trusted certificate:

.. code:: console

 $ sudo a2enmod ssl
 $ sudo a2ensite default-ssl
 $ sudo service apache2 restart

Installation
============

Firstly, install mod_shib. You can do this using the following command:

.. code:: console

 $ sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-shib2

Then, generate certificates for mod_shib by running the following command:

.. code:: console

 $ sudo shib-keygen

Download and Filter the ADFS Metadata
=====================================

The metadata provided by ADFS cannot be automatically imported, and must be cleaned up before using it with the file based MetadataProvider.
To do so, use ``adfs2fed.php``, as in the following command:

.. code-block:: console

  php apps/user_shibboleth/tools/adfs2fed.php \
     https://hostname.<AD-Domain>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml \
     <AD-Domain> > /etc/shibboleth/filtered-metadata.xml

Configure mod_shib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, you need to configure mod_shib. 
To do this, in ``/etc/shibboleth/shibboleth2.xml``:

1. Use the URL of the ownCloud instance as the ``entityID`` in the ``ApplicationDefaults``, e.g.,

   .. code:: xml

    <ApplicationDefaults entityID="https://cloud.hostname.com/login/saml" REMOTE_USER="eppn upn">

   .. note::

    ``https://cloud.hostname.com/login/saml`` is just an example adjust to your needs.

2. Configure the SSO to use the ``entityID`` from the ``filtered-metadata.xml``, e.g.,

   .. code:: xml

    <SSO entityID="https://sts.hostname.tld/11537aff-6d87-4bb1-ae81-d26948b8ea28/">
        SAML2
    </SSO>

3. Configure an XML ``MetadataProvider`` with the local ``filtered-metadata.xml`` file:

   .. code:: xml

    <MetadataProvider type="XML" file="/etc/shibboleth/filtered-metadata.xml"/>

Metadata Available
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under ``https://cloud.hostname.tld/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata`` mod_shib exposes the Metadata that is needed by ADFS to add the SP as a Relying party.

ADFS
-----

This part needs to be done by an ADFS administrator. 
Let him do his job while you continue with the Apache configuration below. 

Add a Relying Party Using Metadata
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See `AD FS 2.0 Step-by-Step Guide <https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg317734(v=ws.10).aspx>`_ step 2.

Configure ADFS to send the userPrincipalName in the SAML token
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you have control over ADFS make it send the ``UPN`` as ``eppn`` by adding the following custom claim rule:

.. code-block:: xml

   c:[Type == "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn"]
   => issue(Type = "urn:oid:1.3.6.1.4.1.5923.1.1.1.6", Value = c.Value, Properties["http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claimproperties/attributename"] = "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:attrname-format:uri");

This will allow the default configuration of mod_shib to pick up the ``userPrincipalName`` and present it as the ``eppn`` to the SP.
If something prevents you from sending a custom rule send the ``userPrincipalName`` and change mod_shibs ``attribute-map.xml`` to

.. code:: xml

 <Attributes xmlns="urn:mace:shibboleth:2.0:attribute-map" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
     <Attribute name="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn" id="upn"/>
 </Attributes>

That will make the ``userPrincipalName`` available as the environment variable ``upn``.

Apache2
-------

To protect ownCloud with shibboleth you need to protect the URL with a mod_shib based ``auth``. 
Currently, `we recommend protecting everything <https://doc.owncloud.org/server/10.0/admin_manual/enterprise/user_management/user_auth_shibboleth.html#the-apache-shibboleth-module>`_ and adding a few exceptions.

user_shibboleth
===============

When the app is enabled and ownCloud is protected by mod_shib, due to the Apache 2 configuration, you should be forced to authenticate against an ADFS. 
After a successful authentication you will be redirected to the ownCloud login page, where you can login as the administrator.
Double check you have a valid SAM session by browsing to https://cloud.hostname.tld/Shibboleth.sso/Session.

In the "User Authentication" settings for Shibboleth the ``eppn`` or ``upn`` environment variables will be filled with the authenticated userâ€™s ``userPrincipalName`` in the "Server Environment" section. 

Use ``eppn`` or ``upn`` as ``uid`` and set the app mode to 'SSO Only'.
``displayName`` and email are only relevant for ``autoprovisioning`` mode. 
Add Claims in ADFS and map them in the ``attribute-map.xml`` if needed. 

Testing
=======

- Close the browser tab to kill the session. 
- Then visit https://cloud.hostname.tld again. 
- You should be logged in automatically.
- Close the tab or delete the cookies to log out. 
- To make the logout work see the Logout section in this document.

Debugging
=========

In ``/etc/shibboleth/shibd.logger`` set the overall behavior to debug:

.. code-block:: ini

 # set overall behavior
 log4j.rootCategory=DEBUG, shibd_log, warn_log
 [...]

After a restart ``/var/log/shibbloeth/shibd.log`` will show the parsed SAML requests and also which claims / attributes were found and mapped, or why not.

Browsers
========

-  For Chrome there is a `SAML Chrome Panel <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/saml-chrome-panel/paijfdbeoenhembfhkhllainmocckace>`__ that allows checking the SAML messages in the developer tools reachable via F12.
-  For Firefox there is `SAML tracer <https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/saml-tracer/>`__
-  In the Network tab of the developer extension make sure that "preserve logs" is enabled in order to see the redirects without wiping the existing network requests

Logout
======

In SAML scenarios the session is held on the SP as well as the IdP.
Killing the SP session will redirect you to the IdP where you are still logged in, causing another redirect that creates a new SP session, making logout impossible. 
Killing only the IdP session will allow you to use the SP session until it expires. 

There are multiple ways to deal with this: 

1. By default ownCloud shows a popup telling the user to close the browser tab. That kills the SP session. If the whole browser is closed the IdP may still use a Kerberos-based authentication to provide SSO in effect making logout impossible. 
2. Hide the logout action in the personal menu via CSS. This forces users to log out at the IdP. 

OAuth2
======

In upcoming versions the clients will use OAuth2 to obtain a device specific token to prevent session expiry, making the old ``/oc-shib/remote.php/nonshib-webdav`` obsolete
